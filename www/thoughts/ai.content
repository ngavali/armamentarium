<h3><a href="#thoughts" onclick="_().loadContent(this,'thoughts','ContentBody');" >Thoughts</a> - AI</h3></p>
Why do we feel AI is dangerous and will overtake humans, is it because subconciously we feel we have done same to other forms of creation.
If we think we are intelligent and compassionate species, then why we are unable to accept that AI which will be our creation will not exhibit same characteristics. Is it all about human nature, loosing the supremacy in the game of life?
