<h3><a href="#thoughts" onclick="_().loadContent(this,'thoughts','ContentBody');" >Thoughts</a> - AI</h3></p>
With AI we might hold power to create another intelligent form different than ours. Still, many perceive it as a danger and think that it will overtake humans. Why we think that way, is that because subconciously we fell we might have done same with other forms of life.</p>
But let us think/assume we are the creation of an intelligent creator (Aka God) who has reserved a special compassion for humans (since we do see to have special abilities compared to other animals). If we posses similar characteristics, then why we are unable to accept that AI (which will be our creation) will not exhibit the same. Is that all about us, loosing the supremacy in the game of life? Did God loose his supremacy?
