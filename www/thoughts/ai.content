Why do we feel AI is dangerous technology and will overtake humans, is it because subconciously we feel we have done same to other forms of life around us.</p>
With AI we might hold power to create another intelligent form different than ours. If we think we are the creation of an intelligent and compassionate superpower and posses similar characteristics, then why we are unable to accept that AI which will be our creation will not exhibit same characteristics. Is that all about us, loosing the supremacy in the game of life?
