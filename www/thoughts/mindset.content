<h3><a href="#thoughts"  >Thoughts</a> - Mindset</h3></p>
Having a right mindset is an important and difficult thing to achieve unless it is inculcated in your upbringing, years over years. However, one must ask first, what is a right mindset, it could be subjective. 

What about objective part, can we describe something in that terms. Mindset must be something that shall at the least help you protect from the sense of being troubled. Help you see and identify things with clarity. It's about accepting and dealing the reality of the world while maintaining the your own traquility.

Definitely it starts with what is in your control. Absolutely nothing, other than your own self (and that too I feel it only up to certain extent). The control can be deliberate or situational and we have choices. And it in excercising the choices comes the art of handling thing and controlling things or events. Remember, at the end it's only the self that you can try to excercise complete control that dictates the previous statement.</p>Ask yourself what do you do to achieve same? 
How you think or act. How you maintain your body that nutures the mindset. Are you giving enough to yourself or you are just busy in crontolling things beyond your domain that is self. You dont control things outside your domain you manage them, understand this.
