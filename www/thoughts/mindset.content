Having a right mindset is important and it is quite something difficult to achieve. Unless it is inculcated in your upbringing, by deliberate practice years over years. However, one might ask, what is a right mindset, is that subjective? What about objective part, can we describe something in that terms. Should it be something that shall at the least help you protect from the sense of being troubled or lower your energy input into unecessary or wasteful tasks. Something that helps you see and identify things with clarity. About accepting and dealing with the realities of the world while maintaining the your own traquility.

What is this tranquility, what is in your control and how you deal with things that surround you. Are you in control of those external things? but yeah let us focus on the former one for now. Absolutely, nothing is in your pure complete control, other than your own self (and that too I feel it is only up to certain extent, extent to which regorious habits are excercised. But, then there is still a practical limit for everything, atleast for physical entities eg. speed of light). The control can be deliberate or situational and we do have choices. And in executing the choices comes the art of handling things and not falling prey to controlling things or events. Remember, at the end it's only the self that you can try to excercise complete control that we talked about in the previous statement at the most.</p> Ask yourself what do you do to achieve same? 
How you think or act. How you maintain your body that nutures the mindset. Are you giving enough time to yourself or you are just busy in crontolling things beyond your domain that is self. You dont control things outside your domain you manage them, understand this. How do you get better in managing and dealing with things that happen around you and what do you do about them, what are your actions that will make a difference to you and to the society as a whole, the world we live in.
