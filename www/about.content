Hey there! I am Nilesh, and have created this tiny space in the Internet that hosts collection of my musings with computer systems and software, some life learnings and other experiences.</p>
Some of the pages might only include weblinks to useful resources, as I think that there is no point in repetition if things are already explained nicely by someone out there and unless you can improve upon it.</p>
I hope you will find these resources useful, more than just interesting.</p>
Happy learning!</p>
