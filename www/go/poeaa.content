This articles reflect my understanding of the concepts presented by Martin Fowler, in his book "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture". 
I felt it was worthwhile getting my hands dirty implement those concepts using Go programming langauge.
It might not be an accurate or complete implementation and I will be more than happy to have a feedback at gavali.nilesh80186@gmail.com.</p>
