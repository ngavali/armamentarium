<h3><a href="#math" onclick="_().loadContent(this,'math','ContentBody');" >Mathematics</a> - The Monty Hall problem intuition</h3>

When I first heard and learned about this problem, it was very difficult to believe the answe and after some careful thought processing the answer became apparently reasonable. 
Why to talk about such problems, it is always interesting and fun to learn about such problems as they tickle your brain and forces you to re-establish a new status quo of your existing knowledge and understanding. And also, things are not as we see at first and close examination can reveal the true nature of things and events. So without any further ado lets look at the problem statement for those who are already know about the same can directly go to intuition section.</p>

In a game show you can win a car by choosing one of the 3 doors, behind one of the door is a car and rest has goats. You choose a door (say door#1), and then the host opens up one of the rest and reveals that it has a goat (say behind door#2) and asks - "would you like to switch your choice with an another unopened door" (which is door#3). What would be your choice, stick to earlier choosen door#1 or switch to door#3?</p>
<h4>Intuition</h4>
The probability of selecting the door having a car behind it = 1/3, in this world if you switch you are likely to loose the car.</br>
Now, the probability of selecting the door having no car behind it = 1-1/3 = 2/3, this event is more likely to happen than the above. In this world, the only option host has is to open a door which has goat behind it. If you switch you are absolutely sure of winning a car.</br>
