<h2><a href="#db"  > Database</a> - 2PC: Two Phase Commit</h2>
Has 2 Phases, hence the name. Has 2 actors - Coordinator and Participant.
<ul>
<li>Prepare - Coordinator asks all participants to <b>prepare</b> the change(s).</li>
<li>Commit  - Coordinator asks all participants to <b>commit</b> the change(s).</li>
</ul>
Is a blocking protocol since resources are blocked during the entire transaction. That is not the case with <a href="#ds/saga" >SAGA</a>.</p>
