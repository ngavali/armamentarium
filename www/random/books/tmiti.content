<h3>The most important things is</h3>
<ol>
<li>Second-Level thinking</li>
<li>Understanding market efficiency and its limitations</li>
<li>Value
<ul>
<li>Value Investing</li>
<li>Growth Investing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relationship between Price and Value<br/>It is not enough to buy a share in a good idea, or even a good business. You must buy it at a reasonable (or, hopefully, a bargain) price</li>
<li>
Understanding Risk
<ul>
<li>Understand it</li>
<li>Recognize when it's high</li>
<li>Controlling it</li>
</ul>
Volatility is not Risk. The possibility of permanent loss is the risk that Marks talks about. And every practical investor worries about it.<br/>
Remarks- “PAUL JOHNSON: I would go so far as to say that the risk of permanent capital loss is the only risk to worry about.”<p/>
Different types of risks
<ul>
<li>Falling short to one's goal - Failure to meet investment goal poses a risk</li>
<li>Underperformance</li>
<li>Liquidity</li>
</ul>
Skillful investors can get a sense for the risk present in a given situation. They make that judgement primarily based on (a) the stability and dependability of value and (b) the relationship between price and value. Other things will enter into their thinking, but most will be subsumed under these two.<p/>
Look at Sharpe Ratio.<p/>
For private assets lacking market prices—like real estate and whole companies—there’s no alternative to subjective risk adjustment.<p/>
Did the investor do a good job of assessing the risk entailed? That’s another good question that’s hard to answer. Need a model? Think of the weatherman. He says there’s a 70 percent chance of rain tomorrow. It rains; was he right or wrong? Or it doesn’t rain; was he right or wrong? It’s impossible to assess the accuracy of probability estimates other than 0 and 100 except over a very large number of trials.<p/>
“Risk means more things can happen than will happen.” - Elroy Dimson.<p/>
Remarks - “HOWARD MARKS: Understanding uncertainty: The possibility of a variety of outcomes means we mustn’t think of the future in terms of a single result but rather as a range of possibilities. The best we can do is fashion a probability distribution that summarizes the possibilities and describes their relative likelihood. We must think about the full range, not just the ones that are most likely to materialize. Some of the greatest losses arise when investors ignore the improbable possibilities.”

<li>Recognizing the Risk<p/>
“The received wisdom is that risk increases in the recessions and falls in booms. In contrast, it may be more helpful to think of risk as increasing during upswings, as financial imbalances build up, and materializing in recessions.” - Andrew Crockett<br/>
Great investing requires both generating returns and controlling risk. And recognizing risk is an absolute prerequisite for controlling it.
