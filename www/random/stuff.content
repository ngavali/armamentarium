Living things (such as humans, pets, and plants) and non-living things (like balls and sand) share a fundamental similarity - they are all constructed from the same basic building blocks.
<p/>
Living organisms are primarily composed of cells. These microscopic units of life vary greatly in complexity, ranging from single-celled organisms like bacteria to complex multicellular beings such as humans. Despite their differences, all cells share common features and functions.
<p/>
Microbes, although often associated with disease, encompass a vast array of microscopic organisms, many of which are essential for life on Earth. Like cells, microbes can exist as single-celled entities or form colonies. Some are beneficial, while others can be harmful.

Cells and microbes are both composed of molecules, which are in turn comprised of atoms. Atoms are the fundamental units of matter and are ubiquitous in the universe. They consist of a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by orbiting electrons. However, this simplistic model, reminiscent of a miniature solar system, belies the intricacies of atomic structure, which we will explore further in subsequent chapters.

The incredible diversity of matter arises from variations in the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons within atoms, giving rise to 118 distinct elements. These elements combine in myriad ways to form the substances found in our everyday lives, from the iron in magnets to the calcium in our bones.
<p/>
Despite their minuscule size, atoms are far from solid entities. In fact, approximately 99% of an atom's volume is empty space, with electrons whirling around the nucleus in a cloud-like fashion. These electrons carry a negative charge, while protons, which reside in the nucleus, are positively charged. Neutrons, also found in the nucleus, lack any electrical charge.

Unlike protons and neutrons, which are composed of smaller particles known as quarks, electrons are considered fundamental particles, incapable of further subdivision. This fundamental nature underscores their importance in the fabric of the universe.

While cells are visible under a microscope, atoms are beyond the reach of conventional optical instruments. So how did we come to understand their existence and properties? The answer lies in the ingenious experiments and theoretical frameworks developed by scientists over centuries of inquiry.
