With the development in AI technology, we might hold power to create an intelligent form like us or better. Many perceive it as a threat, thinking that will overtake humans. Why we think that way, is it because subconciously we feel, we might have done same with other forms of life.</p>
But, let us think/assume we are the creation of an intelligent creator (AKA God) and who has a special compassion for humans (since, we do seem to have both observable and comparable special abilities over other animals). If we posses similar characteristics as that of our creator, then why we are unable to accept that AI (our creation) will not exhibit the same. </p>
We accept the fantasy worlds having batman, spiderman, and super heroes just because they exhibit human qualities, but are afraid of AI.
Is that all about humans, loosing the supremacy in the game of life? Did God loose his supremacy?
